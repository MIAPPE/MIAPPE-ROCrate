      "name": "A multi-site experiment in a network of European fields for assessing the maize yield response to environmental scenarios",
      "description": "This dataset comes from the European Union project DROPS (DROught-tolerant yielding PlantS). A panel of 256 maize hybrids was grown with two water regimes (irrigated or rainfed), in seven fields in 2012 and 2013, respectively, spread along a climatic transect from western to eastern Europe, plus one site in Chile in 2013. This resulted in 29 experiments defined as the combination of one year, one site and one water regime, with two and three repetitions for rainfed and irrigated treatments, respectively. A detailed environmental characterisation was carried out, with hourly records of micrometeorological data and soil water status, and associated with precise measurement of phenology. Grain yield and its components were measured at the end of the experiment. The main purpose of this dataset consists in using the environmental characterisation to quantify the genetic variability of maize grain yield in response to the environmental drivers for genotype-by-environment interaction. For instance, allelic effects at QTLs identified over the field network are consistent within a scenario but largely differ between scenarios.",

One experiment was carried out in Chile, in order to enlarge the climatic diversity and to de-correlate environmental variables, such as light intensity vs air temperature, that are often linked in European climates. Experiments were designed with an alpha lattice unbalanced design. Genotypic means of trait values were calculated using a linear mixed model with fixed hybrid and replicate effects, random row and column effects and spatially correlated errors, resulting in best linear unbiased estimations (BLUEs) of the genotypic effect per experiment. Despite different field layout, due to the physical constraints of field size and orientation, the same model was fitted for each experiment.",
